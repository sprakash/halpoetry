# Element Kit

## Due to emerging Javascript technologies and better ECMAScript APIs, Element Kit has been deprecated and will no longer be maintained.

However, quite a few of its more popular features have new homes now:

* [ImageElement](https://github.com/mkay581/image-element) now has the image loading methods.
* [Module](https://github.com/mkay581/module-js) JS package now has many of the utility methods that were once used here.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, please reach out to the maintainer of the above packages.
Happy coding!
