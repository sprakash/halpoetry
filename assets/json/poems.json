You’ll get more bugs.\nThey depend on people like you.\nOtherwise, they would starve.\nBut who do you want to make happy,\nyour mother or a bunch of ants?\nWhat have they done for you?\nNothing. They have no feelings.\n\nThey’ll eat your candy.\nYet you treat them better than you treat me.\nYou keep feeding them.\nBut you never offer me anything."

			"text" : "My Parkinson’s medicine makes\nmy arms shake. The medical\nterm is dyskinesia. That’s\none of the benefits of the disease\nyou learn new words. You\n\nalso learn new meanings for\nold words. When I say my\nwindows are wide open,\nI’m not referring to the computer\nor those in a house. It means\nmy medication is working.\nA half closed window means\nthe medicine is wearing down.\nA closed window means everything\nI do will now become a struggle."

			"text" : "When the Parkinson’s medication\nwears down, I turn into Cinderella.\nMy means of transportation\nslows down to the speed of\na pumpkin pulled by mice.\nMy shoes still fit my feet.\nBut I take them off. They\nmake too much noise as\nI drag them across the floor."

			"title" : "The Absence Of Light",
			"text" : "God works in mysterious ways, Father said.\nBut he’s not half as mysterious as your mother.\nHe said, Let there be light. And there was light.\nI don’t see anything mysterious about that.\nHe did what He said He’d do.\nYour mother says, Let’s not be late for the movie.\nYet she takes so long getting dressed\nthat it doesn’t pay to go. Then she\ngets mad that I don’t take her any place.\nGod created light where there was only darkness.\nShe only creates confusion."

			"title" : "A Step Above Cows",
			"text" : "I read somewhere that a cow\ncan only walk up stairs but\nnot down. Even though I have\nParkinson’s, I’m a step ahead\nof a cow. I can walk up or down\nwithout much trouble. And the\none time I fell, I was walking up\nbut lost my balance and fell down,\nwhich proves that I’m not\na cow, because for a split second,\nI had the choice of where to fall—\nup or down—and unceremoniously\ntook the down route, because it\ntakes you faster to where you\nwant to go—at the beginning\nof the stairs, so I could do it right this time."

			"text" : "I’ve been a Parkinson’s patient for so long\nthat I can do it in my sleep. And I do.\nI curl up between my wife and the alarm clock\non my night table. From my wife’s side\nI get affection. She never gets mad when\nI wake her up stretching my legs to delay\nthem from becoming rigid. And from\nmy clock, I get insurance that time\nmoves only one way – forward. And\nthat’s the direction I’m going. I don’t\nlook back at what might have been\nif Parkinson’s wasn’t thrust upon me.\nI just try to bear my discomfort quietly\nwithout waking my wife too much."

			"text" : "Your sister says she loves the cat,\nFather said, but it’s your mother\nwho cleans her bowl & changes\nher kitty litter. She does the dirty work.\nYour sister does the enjoyable jobs- she\nfeeds & brushes her. She only deals with\nthe front of the cat & leaves the back half\nfor your mother. But a cat has both a front\n& a back. By right she should be taking turns & not\nleave your mother in charge of the most difficult part."

			"title" : "The Pursuit Of Laziness",
			"text" : "It seems like the only thing you learned\nat college was how to be lazy, Father said.\nWe didn’t feel the need to teach that at home.\nIf you had studied American history you’d\nhave noticed that our founding fathers\nmade no mention of it in the Bill of Rights.\nNowhere is it written that one has the right\nto be lazy. Since you’re a citizen of this country,\nI’m not going to allow you to be lazy in my house.\nIf you don’t like that rule you’re free to swim\na few miles off shore where the laws\nof our government don’t apply. But\nI doubt if you’ll be able to be lazy out there.\nYou’d have to spend all your time just staying afloat."
